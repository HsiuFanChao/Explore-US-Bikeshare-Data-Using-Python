# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data-Using-Python
This is a project of Data Analyst Nanodegree Program from Udacity.
I write a python program to provide the following information:

most common month
most common day of week
most common hour of day

#2 Popular stations and trip

most common start station
most common end station
most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

#3 Trip duration

total travel time
average travel time

#4 User info

counts of each user type
counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago

I don't upload the csv file here because I am not sure if it's legal.
